## Project Description

This project was created to analyze the NFL/Kaggle Dataset for special teams in the NFL

I used LASSO Regularization to find important features that predict best accuracy for a special team's sucess.
Decision Trees were used to predict which side the ball will land during a kick given all the features.

The Presentation is in the keynote file.
